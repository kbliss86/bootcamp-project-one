# Trip Planner Application


## Dev Dynasty's Trip Planner

Users who travel a lot by car often know what cities they are going to go through. Our web application is for users who are planning out a road trip and would like a custom route with all desired locations included. A user inputs their city of origin, their destination city and any intermediate waypoints between those two points, as well as their vehicle's estimated gas mileage, and the application will calculate the route. Our web app will let the user know the total distance traveled, the estimated cost for gas and points of interest for each stop the user makes. The web app itself runs mainly on html and js, as well as uses free APIs and Materialize for css.

By pressing submit a route will be given, the average cost of gas and distance will be calculated, and a brief list of sights to see will be given. The user may add other destinations or waypoints and the web app will account for the changes. To start a new route the user must clear.
